# Prosper Bank Loan Analysis using SQL and Tableau

This repository contains the SQL scripts and serves as a reference for the analysis conducted on Prosper Bank loan data. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the loan dataset using SQL for data querying and manipulation, and to visualize these insights through an interactive dashboard created with Tableau. This analysis aims to identify key factors influencing loan outcomes, borrower characteristics, and loan performance.
